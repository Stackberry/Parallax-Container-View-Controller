Hope you enjoy! It supports landscape. I imagine you'll want to customize the behavior so I figured this would be easier as a single file rather than a CocoaPod. Please excuse the length of the file and the excessive boiler plate, normally that would be reduced by convenience methods in my toolkit, but the toolkit is for a later release ;)

Would love your feedback! We want to make sure that here at Stackberry our coding style and APIs suit the majority of developers. If anything clashes with your style let us know!

Stay tuned for more open source releases, and if you haven't already, check out our Mobile-Backend-as-a-Service at [stackberry.io](https://stackberry.io)

## Future Improvements

Embed View Controllers in Collection View Cells, managing their view lifecycles so that all view controllers are not in the hierarchy at once
